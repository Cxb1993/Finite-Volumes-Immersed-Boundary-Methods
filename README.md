# Finite-Volumes-Immersed-Boundary-Methods

This project contains exactly the code I wrote for my master degree dissertation which dates back to April 2012.
The code you can see here is so awful that I don't even list why.
If you are on this page and you are a recruiter please leave as this is not representative of my current programming skills
in any way. If you are one my colleagues please leave this page because it is embarassing. If you are the interesting girl
that inspired me to publish this please go on.

## How to run a simulation
### Compile the code
You told me you have Linux and by chance this could run ONLY on Linux (just the tip of the iceberg about why this code is awful).
